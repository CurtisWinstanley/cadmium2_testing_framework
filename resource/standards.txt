Above is a description of my state machine in JSON format. Can you please provide me with 3 test cases?
The input data MUST be in the form:
Input Data: {Input Port Name{(input time), [input value]}}

The expected outputs MUST be in the form:
Expected Outputs: {Ouptut Port Name{(output sequence number), [expected output]}}

And finally could you also provide the state transition path in the form of:
State Transition Path: {initial state name,...., final state name}

Assume that the initial state is always WAIT_A.
